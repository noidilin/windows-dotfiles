# AGENT Guideline for opencode

## Environment

- These XDG base directory structure have been setup:
  - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` = `$HOME\.config`
  - `XDG_DATA_HOME` = `$HOME\.local\share`
  - `XDG_CACHE_HOME` = `$HOME\.cache`
- You can use these CLI tools: `fd`, `sd`, `grep`, `ripgrep`, `ast-grep`, `imagemagick`
- Use commands that is available in my main shell - `nu` first
  - if command didn't work out, try alternative command in `pwsh` and `cwd`
